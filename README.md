# Demand Prediction

This repository demonstrates the design of a demand prediction model for services. Multiple models are constructed to showcase their efficiency in predicting demand.

### Setup

* set the python version locally to 3.9.8
* create a virtual environment using the `venv` module
* activate your newly created environment 
* upgrade `pip` (This step is not absolutely necessary, but will save you trouble when installing some packages.)
* install the required packages via `pip`


### Environment

This repo contains a requirements.txt file with a list of all the packages and dependencies to run files smoothly. 


In order to install the environment you can use the following commands:

```bash
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
